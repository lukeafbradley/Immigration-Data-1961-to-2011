# Immigration-Data-1961-to-2011
A research project compiling census information and examining trends in the time, origin, and destination of various immigrant groups in Canada.

##### Primary Data: 

The database I will be using is the Canadian Census Analyzer from the University of Toronto. This data will allow to examine trends in immigration according to census data begininning in 1961. 

This data has its strengths and weaknesses, and it would be useful to have information before 1961, as I imagine it would highlight a significant trend in terms of immigration to urban versus rural areas over the 20th century. However, it also provides the data in a number of output formats, which will allow me to extract the data in whatever format I find most useful.

You can find the database [here](http://dc1.chass.utoronto.ca.proxy.library.carleton.ca/census/)

#####Collection method:

I imagine the collection method here will be fairly straight-forward. The database is surprisingly user-friendly, and - as mentioned before - is readily available in a number of output formats. However, if need be, OutwitHub will be my primary method of collecting largers sums of data from the database. However, due to the available search terms, I don't imagine I will be extracting vast quantities of data at once. 

#####Repository structure:

From now on any reading that I've looked at in terms of examining census data will be posted in the repository as notes, so that people have an idea of the way I'm looking at the data. Also, ideally this would also include a branch for basic notes and ideas specific to the project.

I'm still struggling to understand all the ways repositories can be used, but I'm hoping the next week will give me some time to really lay out a firm structure for [this repo.](https://github.com/lukeafbradley/Immigration-Data-1961-to-2011)

#### Secondary Readings:

[This](https://github.com/lukeafbradley/My-Research-Notebook/blob/master/Bibliography), it is hoped, will be drastically increasing in the next week or so. I will also have to add a branch to the project repo.

##### Initial Thoughts:

Using this data, I'll be able to examine trends in immigration according to country of origin and according to municipality. For instance, I will be able to see how the number of Indian immigrants changed from 1961 o 1971, but I will also be able to visualize changes in the areas of Canada those groups lived in over the years. Also helpful is the column describing the "part" of the Metropolitan area, describing various areas as "urban centres, rural fringes," and so-on.

I'd imagine this will primarily require mapping software to show where in Canada particular immigrant groups are living at any given time. This will also require more than one map, to visualize the change from 1961 to 1971, and so-on. Optimally, this would allow someone to scroll down a number of embedded interactive maps according to the time period.

In my head, the best case scenario would be a homunculus of sorts, where the size of a province or municipal area on a map is reflected in proportion to the number of members of a particular immigrant group there are. Alongside any map, however, I'm going to need a number of charts and graphs (pie charts showing the distribution of various immigrant groups, graphs showing the rise in a total number of immigrants in a given area over time, etc.) The visualization is, I think, the most ambitious aspect of the project, as I'm hoping to cover a fairly broad range of datasets. That is perhaps because we haven;t covered a lot of visualization software yet, particularly in terms of mapping. Once I'm aware of my own abilities and limitations I hope to better lay out what I hope to get out of it.
